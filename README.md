# burn-our-FPGA
Work for EESDC8.

# Why is burn-our-FPGA
It's actually our team name. When we applied for this competition, we were struggling with experiment of digital circuits. Due to an accident we broke our FPGA.(Bingfei broken) So here comes our team name.

# Some goals
1. Learn Unity and each one make a demo independently, maybe unrelated to our final work.
2. Think about what we will do.
